This project will give you full instructions of how to downgrade your iphone from 2.0 back to 1.1.4 and fix the "No Service" issue after the downgrade.

DISCLAIMER. Please note i am note responsible for the outcome of your phone and you do the following at your risk.

Ok so your at the point where your iphone, has been upgraded to firmware 2.0 or above and you cannot jailbreak it.

Don't worry too much heres how to fix it...
Make sure your iphone is NOT plugged in at this stage.

First of all, all the links you need are to the right of the page and are numbered. It is suggested you right click on each and open link in new window to keep this page open.

1. Ok first of all you need to uninstall itunes 7.7 and reinstall itunes 7.5
- Go to control panel and click add remove programs and uninstall itunes.
- Click link 1. to the right and download itunes 7.5 from file hippo. Once installed do not open it.

2. Now you've installed it, before you open it, go to My Documents > My Music > iTunes. Now move or delete the file itunes library from this folder.

3. Now you need to download iphone firmware 1.1.4 you can get this from link 2 on the right and save it to your desktop.

4. Open itunes 7.5
- Plug in your iphone.
- Now you need to put you phone into DFU/Recovery mode. To see how to do this, click link 3 to the right.

5. Itunes should pick up the fact your iphone is in DFU/Recovery mode and should tell you that you cannot use it until you restore it. Click OK on that message. Now, instead of clicking restore like normal, hold shift and click restore at the same time. itunes will show a pop up window looking for a file. Click on the firmware file on your desktop you downloaded earlier.
> This process may take some time. it took me about 15 mins but it has been known to take hours. Try not to disconnect if possible.

<<If you get the error message Cannot restore for unknown reason error (20) or (6) or (1015) etc... please make sure you are using itunes 7.5. You can double check this by clicking help in itunes then about itunes>>

6. Your iphone should now be restored. and can be Jailbroken with Ziphone - link 4 to the right.

7. It also came to my attention that you may have NO SERVICE once you have jailbroken your iphone. If this is the case, you need to download Kiphone from link 5 to the right. Once downloaded, connect you iphone whilst it is on and make sure itunes picks it up. Now open the zipped kiphone folder you downloaded and extract it to the desktop. Go into it and double click the orange icon. This should pick up your iphone. Once open, select downgrade baseband and debug boot and the click start.

This should reboot your phone in DFU mode and white text will scroll down the screen. It should take about 3-5mins.

Once complete your iphone is back to normal.
